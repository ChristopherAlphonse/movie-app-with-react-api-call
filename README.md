# Use useStae hook to change my value dynamically

- Key take away 
- import {useState}
- create a variable give it an array , in this case it is const = [counter,setCounter] = useState() , use a concept of destructuring 
- rule of thumb, index 1 should be name set because it is a setter function for the first variable not required but it is semantic and easdy to read
- anyting with the key word (USE) is a hook
